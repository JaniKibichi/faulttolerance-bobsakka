# Fault Tolerance
Akka provides tools to make applications more resilient, basically implementing the let-it-crash principle. These concepts are:
- Supervision
- Monitoring
- Actor Lifecycle<br>
We always write code to embrace the notion of failure. The fault tolerance strategies available are:
- Isolation
- Structure to enable isolation
- Redundancy
- Replacement
- Reboot
- Component lifecycle
- Suspend
- Separation of concerns
